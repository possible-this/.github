# Welcome to Possible This

**Possible This** is an innovative R&D project and content engine leveraging the Google Gemini API to explore and categorize future scenarios based on the Speculative Design Framework (Futures Cone).

Our mission is to transform user-submitted narratives—from news to speculation to conspiracies—into structured, analyzed content and quantitative social research.
